# maxPossible Task solution description
- The task requirement is:
Write a function that makes the first number as large as possible by
swapping out its digits for digits in the second number.
maxPossible(9328, 456) ➞ 9658
9658 is the largest possible number built from swaps from 456.
3 replaced with 6 and 2 replaced with 5.

  maxPossible(523, 76) ➞ 763

  maxPossible(9132, 5564) ➞ 9655

  maxPossible(8732, 91255) ➞ 9755
- For solving task doing following steps:
1. Converting two numbers into arrays,
2. SecondNum sorting numbers from large to small
3. Comparing digits
4. Returning firstArray with join method (converting array to number)
